## A meeting about big data and neural network involved this project

Dr. Shibberu and Zhihao Xue

#### What machine learning side for?
* collect user input data
* collect how user play the game
* analysis data 
* recognize input commands
* learn how to play the game

#### What would the game like to be?
* input commands can be labeled very well -- for machine learning
* can be played remotely
* easy to control
* this game should be played in physical world


#### Where is data and neural network stored?
* On Rose Server
* Maybe need a powerful machine -- gauss is ok for now

#### What is our stretch goal?
* A mail distribute robot on campus

#### Additional comments
* ZX - Talk to Darryl about VMs and servers
